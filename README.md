#Mozilla Nepal Localization Helper (for Pootle)

This is a helper utility for localization. It utilizes google translate api (a dirty hack, by the way) to fetch translation of given string to (currently) nepali language. 
Server side is implemented on plain php, and client side is being worked as an addon.
